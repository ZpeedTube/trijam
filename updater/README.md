# updater

## installation 
For this program to work you need to have installed Node.js with npm AND github command line interface.
You can find Node.js here https://nodejs.org/ and github CLI here https://github.com/cli/cli .
Then use 'git clone https://github.com/ZpeedTube/trijam' to download this github repository.
After installing these the final step is to open (this) folder in terminal and type 'npm i' wich will download and install the updater dependencies.
You should be done now.

## usage
Before run this you need to sign in with your github account, use this first 'sudo git config --global credential.helper store' so you don't have to re sign in every time.
Then run this 'git pull' and should now ask for your credentials when you run this 'git push', remember that you have to be in the trijam folder that you downloaded with git clone.
Open (this) folder in your terminal and type 'npm start' or 'node .'.
